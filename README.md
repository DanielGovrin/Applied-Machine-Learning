# Applied-Machine-Learning
This repository represents the 'Applied machine learning' course I took at BGU university. In the course we learned machine learning models, clustering, 
dimensional reduction, deep learning and more. To see the full syllabus of the course you can visit the lecturer site: https://www.moshesipper.com/aml.html
This course got me so intrigued about machine learning and I'm looking forward to start my own projects and getting better at it.
Each folder is an assignment we got during the course, most of the times I tried to do thing beyond what we asked for in class.
