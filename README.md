# Applied-Machine-Learning
This repository represents the 'Applied machine learning' course I took at BGU university. In the course we learned machine learning models, clustering, 
dimensional reduction, deep learning and more.
Each folder represent an assignment we got during the course. most of the times I tried to do thing beyond what we asked for in class.
